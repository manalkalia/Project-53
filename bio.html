        <h1>Biography Of Usain Bolt</h1><br><br>
        <p>Usain St. Leo Bolt OJ CD OLY is a retired Jamaican sprinter, widely considered to be the 
            greatest sprinter of all time. He is the world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres,
             and 4 × 100 metres relay. Wikipedia

        <p>That means that Bolt's speed during his world-record run was 10.44 meters per second. 
            Since many people are more familiar with automobiles and speed limits, it might be more
             useful to think of this in terms of kilometers per hour or miles per hour: 37.58 or 
             23.35, respectively.

        <p>Of the two prodigies, Knighton has the clearest evidence of being faster than Bolt at the
             same age. The 19-year-old is still running in his final year as a junior, yet has already
              achieved multiple times that are faster than Bolt's greatest U-20 marks.9 Jun 2023

        <p>As booing echoed around the Olympic stadium in London on 5 August, the on-track cameraman 
            circled Justin Gatlin as he bowed at the feet of Usain Bolt. The American had stunned the 
            world by beating Bolt in the Jamaican's last 100m final, only to be received as a pantomime 
            villain.
